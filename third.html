              <p>Arithmancy was a branch of magic concerned with the magical properties of numbers.
                 It was a favourite subject of Hermione Granger. Arithmancy was reportedly difficult,
                  as it required memorising or working with many charts.
                   It was also an elective course that could be taken by students third year and above.
                   The subject was taught by Professor Septima Vector.
                    It was separated into normal Arithmancy and Advanced Arithmancy Studies.</p>

            <h1>Care of Magical Creatures</h1>
            <p>Care of Magical Creatures was a class which instructed students on how
               to care for magical beasts. Classes were held outside the castle.
                In Harry's first two years, the class was taken by Professor Silvanus
                 Kettleburn who then retired "in order to enjoy more time with his remaining
                  limbs". Dumbledore then recruited the gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid to accept
                   a teaching position along with his gamekeeping duties.
                    <br><br>
                    Although Hagrid was obviously very experienced and knowledgeable, he consistently 
                    misjudged the risk that the animals he used in his lessons pose to his students,
                     which sometimes resulted in chaos. When Hagrid was absent, his lessons were taken 
                     over by Professor Grubbly-Plank, an acquaintance of Dumbledore's.

          <h1>Divination</h1>
          <p>Divination was the art of predicting the future. Various methods were described, 
            including tea leaves, fire-omens, crystal balls, palmistry, cartomancy (including 
            the reading of conventional playing cards and the tarot), astrology, and dream
             interpretations. Divination was described by Professor McGonagall as "one of the 
             most imprecise branches of magic". Supporters of the subject claimed that it was 
             an inexact science that required innate gifts like the "Inner Eye". Those opposed 
             claimed that the subject was irrelevant and fraudulent.
                  <br><br>
                  Harry was first taught Divination by Professor Trelawney, and then later by 
                  Firenze after Trelawney was sacked by Dolores Umbridge in Harry's fifth year.
                   In his sixth (and presumably seventh) year, Firenze and Professor Trelawney 
                   taught Divination. Divination was considered to be a very tiring class.

        <h1>Muggle Studies (core in 1997–1998 only)</h1>
        <p>Muggle Studies was a class taught by Charity Burbage, which involved 
          the study of the Muggle (non-magical) culture "from a wizarding point 
          of view". It also included Muggle Art and Muggle Music. The only need 
          for witches and wizards to learn about Muggle ways and means was to 
          ensure they could blend in with Muggles while needing to do so (for 
          example, at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup).
                <br><br>
           Voldemort murdered Professor Charity Burbage because she portrayed 
           Muggles in a positive light and was opposed to limiting wizardry to
            only people of pure-blood origins.[39] For the rest of that academic
             year, Alecto Carrow, a Death Eater, taught Muggle Studies. However, 
             her lessons (which were made compulsory) mainly described Muggles and
              Muggle-borns as subhuman and worthy of persecution.
