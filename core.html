                 <p>Astronomy was the only field of study at Hogwarts that had a direct equivalent in the Muggle world.
                    Astronomy classes took place in the Astronomy Tower, the tallest tower in Hogwarts, and were taught 
                    by Professor Aurora Sinistra. Lessons involved observations of the night skies with telescopes. 
                    Lessons were held every week at midnight, and first years had lessons on Wednesday.
                      <br><br>
                    Known student homework activities included learning the names of stars,

                <p>Charms were a type of spells concerned with giving an object new and unexpected properties,
                   and hence this class mainly consisted of learning those sorts of spells. 
                   Charms classes were described as notoriously noisy and chaotic, as the lessons were largely practical.
                   Charms was considered a "soft option" by some when picking N.E.W.T.-level classes.</p>

              <p>Defence Against the Dark Arts, commonly shortened to D.A.D.A.,

                  against the Dark Arts, and to be protected from dark creatures.
                  <br><br>
                The subject had an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members — 
                throughout Harry Potter's time at Hogwarts, no Defence Against the
                 Dark Arts teacher remained at Hogwarts for more than one school year.

                  a variety of magical plants of varying degrees of lethality.
                   Herbology was also the subject Neville Longbottom excelled in.
                   He later replaced Professor Pomona Sprout as the Herbology teacher 
                   by 2019. The class was considered to be very exhausting.</p>

            <p>History of Magic was the study of magical history, which was taught by Professor
              Cuthbert Binns. His lessons were depicted as some of the most boring at Hogwarts.
               They were only lectures, given without pause, about significant events
                in wizarding history. Topics had included Goblin Rebellions, Giant wars,
                 and the origins of wizarding secrecy.
                <br><br>
              This was the only class at Hogwarts that was taught by a ghost, as the professor never
               noticed he had died and simply continued teaching as if nothing had changed.
                Many considered this to be the most boring Hogwarts class.</p>

          <h1>Potions</h1>
          <p>Potions was described as the art of creating mixtures with magical effects.
             It required the correct mixing and stirring of ingredients at the right times
              and temperatures. Snape's lessons were depicted as unhappy, oppressing times 
              set in a gloomy dungeon in the basement of the castle, whilst Horace Slughorn's, 
              who replaced Severus Snape as Potions Master, was shown as more cheerful and even fun at times.
              <br><br>
              Potions was also a difficult class to achieve an O.W.L. in, as only twelve students from Harry Potter's 
              year managed it. The O.W.L written exam was described as "difficult".</p>

        <h1>Transfiguration</h1>
        <p>Transfiguration was the art of changing the form or appearance of an object, 
          and hence this was what this class taught. Transfiguration was a theory-based
           subject, including topics such as "Switching Spells" (altering only a part of some object,
            such as giving a human rabbit's ears); Vanishing Spells (causing an object to completely
             disappear); and Conjuring Spells (creating objects out of thin air).
            <br><br>
            It was possible to change inanimate objects into animate ones and vice versa — Minerva McGonagall,
             the class's teacher, transfigured her desk into a pig. According to Minerva McGonagall, 
             "Transfiguration is some of the most dangerous magic you will be taught at Hogwarts".
